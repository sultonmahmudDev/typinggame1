    "Subduction is a geological process in which the oceanic lithosphere and some continental lithosphere is recycled into the Earth's mantle at convergent boundaries. Where the oceanic lithosphere of a tectonic plate converges with the less dense lithosphere of a second plate, the heavier plate dives beneath the second plate and sinks into the mantle. A region where this process occurs is known as a subduction zone, and its surface expression is known as an arc-trench complex.",
    "Tectonic Plates are large, rigid pieces of the Earth’s lithosphere, which is the outermost layer of the Earth. These plates, which vary in size and shape, cover the Earth’s surface. They consist of both the Earth’s crust and the uppermost portion of the mantle. Tectonic plates are in constant motion, floating on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. There are several major and minor tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s surface.",
    "At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other. This movement results in the creation of new crust as magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap. The process, known as seafloor spreading, occurs predominantly along mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is continually generated. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms new sections of the Earth’s crust, pushing the existing plates apart.",
    "Oceanic-Continental Convergence: When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate typically subducts beneath the lighter continental plate. Subduction creates deep ocean trenches and often leads to the formation of volcanic arcs and mountain ranges on the overriding continental plate.",
    "Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence: In this scenario, when two oceanic plates collide, one plate usually subducts beneath the other, leading to the formation of island arcs and deep-sea trenches.",
    "Continental-Continental Convergence: When two continental plates collide, neither plate subducts due to their similar densities. Instead, the intense pressure and compression cause the plates to crumple and fold, creating vast mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas.",
    "Transform boundaries occur when tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally. At these boundaries, the plates grind against each other along faults, causing frequent earthquakes. Unlike the other types of boundaries where crust is either created or destroyed, transform boundaries neither create nor destroy crust. One of the most well-known transform boundaries is the San Andreas Fault in California.",
